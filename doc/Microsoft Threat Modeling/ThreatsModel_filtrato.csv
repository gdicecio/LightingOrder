0;Replay Attacks;Tampering;HTTPS;Packets or messages without sequence numbers or timestamps can be captured and replayed in a wide variety of ways. Implement or utilize an existing communication protocol that supports anti-replay techniques (investigate sequence numbers before timers) and strong integrity.
1;Collision Attacks;Tampering;HTTPS;Attackers who can send a series of packets or messages may be able to overlap data. For example, packet 1 may be 100 bytes starting at offset 0. Packet 2 may be 100 bytes starting at offset 25. Packet 2 will overwrite 75 bytes of packet 1. Ensure you reassemble data before filtering it, and ensure you explicitly handle these sorts of cases.
2;Cross Site Scripting;Tampering;HTTPS;The web server 'Proxy Login' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.
3;Potential Data Repudiation by Proxy Login;Repudiation;HTTPS;Proxy Login claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.
4;Weak Authentication Scheme;Information Disclosure;HTTPS;Custom authentication schemes are susceptible to common weaknesses such as weak credential change management, credential equivalence, easily guessable credentials, null credentials, downgrade authentication or a weak credential change management system. Consider the impact and potential mitigations for your custom authentication scheme.

10;Cross Site Request Forgery;Elevation Of Privilege;HTTPS;Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.

158;Potential Data Repudiation by Artemis;Repudiation;HTTP;Artemis claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.
159;Data Flow Sniffing;Information Disclosure;HTTP;Data flowing across HTTP may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.
160;Potential Process Crash or Stop for Artemis;Denial Of Service;HTTP;Artemis crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly
161;Data Flow HTTP Is Potentially Interrupted;Denial Of Service;HTTP;An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.

165;Spoofing the Artemis Process;Spoofing;HTTP;Artemis may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to Proxy. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source process.
166;Spoofing the Proxy Process;Spoofing;HTTP;Proxy may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Artemis. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process.
167;Potential Lack of Input Validation for Proxy;Tampering;HTTP;Data flowing across HTTP may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Proxy or an elevation of privilege attack against Proxy or an information disclosure by Proxy. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.
168;Replay Attacks;Tampering;HTTP;Packets or messages without sequence numbers or timestamps can be captured and replayed in a wide variety of ways. Implement or utilize an existing communication protocol that supports anti-replay techniques (investigate sequence numbers before timers) and strong integrity.

Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.
181;Proxy Login Process Memory Tampered;Tampering;HTTP;If Proxy Login is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what Artemis executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then Proxy Login can tamper with Artemis. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it.

191;Spoofing of Destination Data Store Configuration File;Spoofing;Generic Data Flow;Configuration File may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Configuration File. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.
192;Authorization Bypass;Information Disclosure;Generic Data Flow;Can you access Configuration File and bypass the permissions for the object? For example by editing the files directly with a hex editor, or reaching it via filesharing? Ensure that your program is the only one that can access the data, and that all other subjects have to use your interface.
193;Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Web Server or Configuration File;Denial Of Service;Generic Data Flow;Does Web Server or Configuration File take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.
194;Weak Credential Storage;Information Disclosure;Generic Data Flow;Credentials held at the server are often disclosed or tampered with and credentials stored on the client are often stolen. For server side, consider storing a salted hash of the credentials instead of storing the credentials themselves. If this is not possible due to business requirements, be sure to encrypt the credentials before storage, using an SDL-approved mechanism. For client side, if storing credentials is required, encrypt them and protect the data store in which they're stored
