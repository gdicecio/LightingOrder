132,Weak Authentication Scheme,Information Disclosure,HTTP,High,Mitigated,"Custom authentication schemes are susceptible to common weaknesses such as weak credential change management, credential equivalence, easily guessable credentials, null credentials, downgrade authentication or a weak credential change management system. Consider the impact and potential mitigations for your custom authentication scheme.",Abbiamo Keycloak
138,Spoofing the Artemis Process,Spoofing,HTTP,High,Mitigated,Artemis may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to Web Server. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source process.,Abbiamo Keycloak
184,Potential Data Repudiation by Artemis,Repudiation,HTTP,High,Mitigated,"Artemis claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.",Tutto ciò che viene fatto è tracciato
193,Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Web Server or Configuration File,Denial Of Service,Generic Data Flow,High,Mitigated,"Does Web Server or Configuration File take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.","Per il Web Server, è possibile l'utilizzo di firewall. Se consideriamo solo l'interazione con il file di configurazione, allora non è applicabile. Metto sotto investigazione solo per la penultima ipotesi."
194,Weak Credential Storage,Information Disclosure,Generic Data Flow,High,Mitigated,"Credentials held at the server are often disclosed or tampered with and credentials stored on the client are often stolen. For server side, consider storing a salted hash of the credentials instead of storing the credentials themselves. If this is not possible due to business requirements, be sure to encrypt the credentials before storage, using an SDL-approved mechanism. For client side, if storing credentials is required, encrypt them and protect the data store in which they're stored",Stessa cosa di prima
