167,Potential Lack of Input Validation for Proxy,Tampering,HTTP,High,Needs Investigation,Data flowing across HTTP may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Proxy or an elevation of privilege attack against Proxy or an information disclosure by Proxy. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.,
